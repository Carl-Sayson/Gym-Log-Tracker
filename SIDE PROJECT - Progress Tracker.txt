SIDE PROJECT - Progress Tracker

wooohhhhhh weehhhh........

GOAL:
- How much progress did I make in a gym? -  Descriptive Analysis / Historical Records


FACTORS / data elements: 
(NOTE: progress made must be done per week, monthly, and year, meaning it will check if there is progress based on these parameters. So, By Monday to Sunday, the system will check how many logs are done per exercise. Example: I have log pull ups twice in a week, then the system will check the data below then statistically analyze it if there were progress done based on the timeline selected):

- Day of training
- Name of exercise
- Type of exercise (Bodyweight or weighted / Free weights)
- Sets (Determiner of data for progress, should be working sets)
- Reps per sets
- Weight (Weighted calisthenic or weightlifting) per set

(Quantifier: MAX REP and MAX WEIGHT to determine progress [plateaud, decline or increase] using one rep max calculation):

Formulas to use:
1. Brzycki formula: Weight × (36 / (37 – number of reps))
2. Epley formula: Weight × (1 + (0.0333 × number of reps))
3. Lombardi formula: Weight × (number of reps ^ 0.1)
4. O’Conner formula: Weight × (1 + (0.025 × number of reps))

NOTE: If bodyweight only, mostly rely on reps or maybe working sets

- 50-60% of one rep max for 3-5 reps (4-6 sets)—Lifting a lower number of reps at a lighter weight can help with promoting explosive power. Since it is a lighter weight and lower number of reps, try to keep the breaks between your sets shorter.

- ~70% of one rep max for 10-15 reps (4-6 sets)—Lifting at around 70% of your 1RM for more repetitions helps promote muscle endurance.

- 70-80% of one rep max for 7-12 reps (3-5 sets)—Lifting in this range can help with muscle growth.

- 80-100% of one rep max for 1-3 reps (3-4 sets)—Lifting in this range promotes a combination of muscle growth, power, and overall strength. Since you are training within or at the upper range of your one rep max, use a spotter whenever possible to decrease risk of injury.
